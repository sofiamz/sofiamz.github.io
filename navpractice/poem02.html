<p>You are here. Oh, you do not run away.<br>
You will answer me to the last cry.<br>
Curl round me as though you were frightened.<br>
Even so, a strange shadow once ran through your eyes.<br></p>

<p>Now, now too, little one, you bring me honeysuckle,<br>
and even your breasts smell of it.<br>
While the sad wind goes slaughtering butterflies<br>
I love you, and my happiness bites the plum of your mouth.<br></p>

<p>How you must have suffered getting accustomed to me,<br>
my savage, solitary soul, my name that sends them all running.<br>
So many times we have seen the morning star burn, kissing our eyes,<br>
and over our heads the gray light unwinds in turning fans.<br></p>

<p>My words rained over you, stroking you.<br>
A long time I have loved the sunned mother-of-pearl of your body.<br>
Until I even believe that you own the universe.<br>
I will bring you happy flowers from the mountains, bluebells,<br>
dark hazels, and rustic baskets of kisses.<br>
I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees.<br></p></p>
